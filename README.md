👋 Hi there! I'm Fuzail Ahamad. I'm a passionate DevOps enthusiast working on automating software delivery pipelines and building scalable infrastructure.

🚀 Currently building robust CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, with integrated SonarQube analysis, Docker containerization, and deployment workflows to AWS ECS via Amazon ECR.

💡 I’m especially focused on:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment best practices

Infrastructure automation and container orchestration

Improving code quality and delivery speed

Hands-on experience with Linux, scripting, and open-source tools

🛠️ Tech I use:

CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions

Containers: Docker, Amazon ECR, ECS

Code Quality: SonarQube

Cloud: AWS

OS: Linux (daily driver!)

📘 Currently exploring:

Kubernetes fundamentals

Terraform for infrastructure as code

Monitoring and observability tools like Prometheus + Grafana
